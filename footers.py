	One dark and stormy day, 7R!Xx was troubleshooting the 'cyberS' code, perched on a Starbucks barstool.
	
	Suddenly an interruption from over the shoulder revealed cj_, asking about the code up on the screen.
	
	After a brief coffee and introduction, the two decided to write something together, and a monitoring
	
	tool seemed to be the most appropriate suggestion that came forth. Enter Network Monitoring Tool.
